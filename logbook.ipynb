    "- When can we expect data from coma patients? And are we supposed to train only on publically available data until then?\n",

    "- Oscar: What is meant by clustering in practice?\n",

    "- What is the final goal? To make a good model or preprocessing pipeline that we can pass on or just define which areas of the body are best at classification?\n",

    "##### Goals for next time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a more generalized preprocessing and classification pipeline that can take both BIDS and SNIRF data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do a rough comparison of tongue, finger, and leg data.\n",

    "- Experiment with non-MNE "
